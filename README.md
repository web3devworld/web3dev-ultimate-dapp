 Installation

 Smart Contracts
1. Navigate to the `contracts` directory:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

 Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

 Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

 AI Integration
1. Navigate to the `ai` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs
   ```
3. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   node predict.js
   ```

 Decentralized Storage
1. Navigate to the `storage` directory:
   ```bash
   cd storage
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install ipfs-http-client
   ```
3. Test uploading to IPFS:
   ```bash
   node ipfs.js
   ```

 Deployment

 Smart Contracts Deployment
1. Update the deployment script (`scripts/deploy-contracts.js`) with the desired network configuration (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).
2. Deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contracts.js --network <network-name>
   ```
3. Save the deployed contract addresses for use in the frontend and backend.

 Frontend Deployment
1. Build the frontend for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the build folder to a hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or IPFS.

 Backend Deployment
1. Deploy the backend to a cloud provider like AWS, Heroku, or Render.
2. Ensure environment variables (e.g., API keys, private keys) are securely configured.

 Usage

 Connecting Wallet
1. Open the frontend in your browser.
2. Connect your wallet by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button.
3. Approve the connection in MetaMask.

 Interacting with Smart Contracts
1. Use the frontend interface to interact with deployed smart contracts (e.g., mint NFTs, vote in governance).
2. Monitor transactions on the blockchain explorer for the respective network.

 Using Decentralized Storage
1. Upload files to IPFS or Arweave using the provided scripts.
2. Retrieve files using their CIDs or transaction IDs.

 AI Predictions
1. Use the AI integration to generate predictions or assist with governance decisions.
